{"name":"Verified FTL","tagline":"","body":"# What's FTL?\r\n\r\n1. FTL is the software/firmware between raw NAND flash and the file system.\r\n2. FTL mainly does the address translation.\r\n3. FTL does the wear-leveling to improve the life span of the hardware.\r\n\r\n# Why should we formally verify FTL software?\r\n\r\n1. The FTL algorithm is non-trivial.\r\n2. Buggy software would lead to serious data damage/loss.\r\n3. \r\n\r\n# What can you learn from this project?\r\n\r\n+ The way of defining FTL algorithm formally.\r\n+ The way of specifying correctness requirement of the software.\r\n+ The method to prove the software design.","google":"UA-58140942-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
